                        <p>

Before we can understand artificial intelligence, we must first understand
what intelligence is. We do not have an exact definition for intelligence, but
in this context, intelligence is the ability of something to:

<ol>
    <li>
        Reason
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This refers to the ability of something to find connections between
            two pieces of information
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Learn
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This refers to the ability of something to gain knowledge or skill
            by study, experience, or being taught.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Solve
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This refers to the ability of something to find an answer to a
            problem
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Perceive
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This refers to the ability of something to gather information
            about its surroundings
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Communicate
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This refers to the ability of something to share information
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

                        <h3>Agents and Environments</h3>
                        <p>

To help us visualize how an intelligent system can perceive its surroundings,
we shall take a brief look at the concept of agents and environments.
<ul>
    <li>
        An agent is any system that can perceive its evironment using sensors
        and react to its environment using effectors.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can think of sensors as input devices that gather information
        related to the agent's surroundings. Meanwhile, we can think of
        effectors as output devices that are dependent on the information
        gathered by the sensors.
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, we can think of humans as agents with sensory organs
        (eyes, ears, nose, toungue, ans skin) as sensors and muscles as
        effectors.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can also think of robots as agents. They would have cameras,
        microphones, and other similar devices as sensors. They would also have
        motors, speakers, and other similar devices as effectors.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        Finally, we can also think of software robots (or softbots, as they are
        commonly referred to) as agents who have input fields as sensors and
        output fields as effectors.
    </li>
    <li>
        An environment is the area wherein an agent operates. This environment
        can either be in the real world (such as the environment of human and
        robotic agents) or in an artificial world. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The environment of human and robotic agents is the real world.
        Meanwhile, the environment of softbots are artificial worlds whose
        conditions are controlled by a programmer. These artificial world
        usually consist of large databases, extensive file systems, countless
        input fields, and several output screens.
    </li>
</ul>

                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <hr class="transition" style="margin-top: 30px;">

                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <h3>The Premise</h3>
                        <p>

<b>Artificial Intelligence is a man-made machine, usually a computer of some
sort, that can think like man to some degree</b>. However, considering most of
the machines we see everyday do not possess any sign of intelligence, can we
even make a machine that can think?

                        </p>
                        <p>

To settle this question, a mathematician named Alan Turing proposed a test that
became known as "The Turing Test". This test is very simple: a person and a
machine are given questions or tasks, and the machine will be rated based on how
close its answers and approaches are to the answers and approaches of the
person.

                        </p>
                        <p>

From the Turing test, we derived the three types of AI. First, we have
Artificial Narrow Intelligence, the one thath is practically everywhere, from
the games you play to the social media sites you browse. Then, we have
Artificial General Intelligence, which are AIs that can pass the turing test.
Finally, we have Artificial Superintelligence, an AI that is far smarter and
more capable than man.

                        <h3>The Advantages</h3>
                        <p>

Utilizing Artificial Intelligence has several advantages, such as:
<ol>
    <li>
        AI can learn by simply looking at statistics and information, unlike
        humans, who need an explaination of a concept in order to learn
    </li>
    <li>
        AI can teach itself much faster than humans ever can
    </li>
    <li>
        AI can respond in any time of the day, as long as it is connected to a
        power source. Meanwhile, humans need some time to rest
    </li>
    <li>
        AI is less prone to making mistakes compared to humans
    </li>
    <li>
        AI can efficiently organize data and get the most out of this data
    </li>
</ol>

                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <h3>The Uses</h3>
                        <p>

AI also has a lot of uses in the following fields and more:
<ul>
    <li>Data Science</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            AI can be used to arrange, process, and present data efficiently.
            This will save data scientists a lot of time on their work.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This is actually the mechanism behind predictive text, a commonly
            used feature built into most mobile phones. AI can be used to
            predict the next word a user will type.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Game Development</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            AI can be used to simulate the behavior of non-player characters
            (NPCs). These NPCs make the game more exciting even if you are
            playing alone.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This is the technology that enables self-driving cars. AI can be
            used to accurately let a computer identify objects in an image.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <h3>In summary,</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Artificial Intelligence is a machine that can think like man to some
        degree
    </li>
    <li>
        This means an AI must be able to perceive, reason, solve, learn, and
        commuunicate
    </li>
    <li>
        We can think of an AI as an agent functioning in an environment
    </li>
    <li>
        That environment can be altered to make the AI more efficient
    </li>
    <li>
        The turing test tells us how human-like a machine thinks
    </li>
    <li>
        From the concept of the Turing test, we can derive 3 types of AI: one
        that scores decently (ANI), one that aces the test (AGI), and one that
        gets over perfect (ASI)
    </li>
