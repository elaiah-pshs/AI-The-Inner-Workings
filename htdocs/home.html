                        <h3>The Purpose</h3>
                        <p>

Artificial Intelligence is one of the most promising emerging technologies in
computer science and programming. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined
by John McCarthy in one of his lectures way back during 1956. Back then,
McCarthy could only dream of such a technology. Today, Mcarthy's dream of
Artificial Intelligence has become reality. Better yet, not only did we manage
to create Artificial Intelligence (to some extent), but we also managed to
integrate it to almost every aspect of our lives. However, despite its
popularity and wide usage, many people do not truly understand what Artificial
Intelligence is, how it works, and why we decided to create it in the first
place. That is why this website was made.

                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <p>

This website aims to:
<ul>
    <li>
        Explain what artificial intelligence is to
        people with little to no knowledge on
        programming,
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain why AI was created in the first place,
    </li>
    <li>
        Expound on how an AI is created, and
    </li>
    <li>
        Clear up some misconceptions about artificial
        intelligence
    </li>
</ul>

                        </p>

                        <h3>The Strategy</h3>
                        <p>

First, you will be introduced to concepts related to artificial intelligence,
such as intelligence, agents, environments, and the turing test. Then, you will
learn about what AI really is, along with its advantages and uses.

                        </p>
                        <p>

After that, you will be walked through the process of developing a basic AI,
which involves machine learning algorithms, data preparation, and logic
programming

                        </p>
                        <p>

Finally, you will be shown all the applications of AI, such as gaming, natural
language processing, and computer vision. The underlying code for these
applications will also be presented

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            
Pro tip: If there is something you do not understand, try hovering your mouse
over it. There might be a hidden tooltip.
