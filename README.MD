# AI: The Inner Workings

<h2 id="description"> Description </h2>

**AI: The Inner Workings** is a website about Artificial Intelligence, its uses, how it is made, and the myths surrounding it. This website contains everything from:

1. A comprehensive introduction about AI.

2. A series of pages dedicated to how an AI is made

3. A collection of pages explaining the applications of AI in the real world

4. A mythbusters-type minigame related to some common myths about AI

Feel free to point out any issues with the website in the `issues` section! I'm not so strict on Github conventions (because for the most part I don't even follow them HAHAHAHA), so don't be shy.

* The navigation bar used in this website was heavily inspired by the work of Jeff Delaney on this Github repository:
    * [A Responsive Animated CSS Icon Navbar](https://github.com/fireship-io/222-responsive-icon-nav-css)

* The code for hiding scrollbars while still maintaining the website's ability to scroll was taken from this Stackoverflow question posted Oussama el Bachiri
    * [Hide scroll bar, but while still being able to scroll](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16670931/hide-scroll-bar-but-while-still-being-able-to-scroll?page=1&tab=votes#answer-38994837)

* The code for the card system right after each title is also inspired by the work of Jeff Dalaney on this Github repository:
    * [Stacked Card List](https://github.com/fireship-io/stacked-card-list)
