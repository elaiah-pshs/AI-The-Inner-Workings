# AI: The Inner Workings

<h2 id="description"> Description </h2>

**AI: The Inner Workings** is a website about Artificial Intelligence, its uses, how it is made, and the myths surrounding it. This website contains everything from:

1. A comprehensive introduction about AI.

2. A series of pages dedicated to how an AI is made

3. A collection of pages explaining the applications of AI in the real world

4. A mythbusters-type minigame related to some common myths about AI

Check out the explainations to all the code used in this website that you might not be familiar with in the `wiki` section. Also, feel free to point out any issues with the website in the `issues` section! I'm not so strict on Github conventions (because for the most part I don't even follow them HAHAHAHA), so don't be shy.
